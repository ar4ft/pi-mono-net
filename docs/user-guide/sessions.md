# Session Management
Managing persistent conversations.

## What are Sessions?
Sessions store conversation history across restarts.

## Creating Sessions
Sessions are created automatically when you start chatting.

## Loading Sessions
```
> /sessions  # List all
> /load my-project  # Load specific
```

## Storage
Sessions are stored in `~/.pi/sessions/[session-id]/`.

See [Quick Start](quick-start.md) for more details.
